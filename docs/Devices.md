# Devices

This action offers several additional devices in the default images, which are not available in the GitHub runners, but are also not enabled by default. To enable a device simply add its name to the `devices` parameter along with optional parameters.

> **Warnings**
> Adding devices may not work properly with your own kernel. If you want to use your own kernel, check that you have added the correct drivers.

## Devices syntax

```yaml
- uses: antmicro/renode-linux-runner-action@v0
  with:
    devices: |
      device1 param1 param2 param3 ...
      device2 param1 param2 param3 ...
      ...
```

## Available devices

- [`vivid`](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/media/vivid.html) - virtual device emulating a Video4Linux device
- [`gpio`](https://docs.kernel.org/admin-guide/gpio/gpio-mockup.html) - virtual device emulating GPIO lines. Optional parameters:
  - left bound: GPIO line numbers will start from this number
  - right bound: GPIO line numbers will end 1 before this number (for example, `gpio 0 64` will add 64 lines from 0 to 63)
- [`i2c`](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v5.10/i2c/i2c-stub.html) - virtual device emulating `I2C` bus. Optional parameter:
  - chip_addr: 7 bit address 0x03 to 0x77 of the chip that simulates the EEPROM device and provides read and write commands to it.
