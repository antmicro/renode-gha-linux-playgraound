# Image

This section details how to work with `image` packages that are compatible with this action. You can treat these images like containers: they provide the userspace software you need, compiled on the specified processor architecture, but have nothing to do with device drivers, the kernel, or the bootloader.

## Image type

There are two types of images that are compatible with this action:

* native: all files are placed in the `.tar.xz` archive
* docker: docker container

### Native images

A native image is just an archive with a full Linux rootfs. You can add any files you want. The only requirement is a `/bin/sh` and binaries compiled for the specified architecture.

### Docker images

The Docker image type is a standard docker image. The action will repack the latest layer into the standard .tar.xz archive and everything will continue as in the native image. The docker images are downloaded from Dockerhub. This is an example of using the docker image type:

```yaml
- uses: antmicro/renode-linux-runner-action@v0
  with:
    arch: riscv64
    image-type: docker
    image: riscv64/debian:experimental
    renode-run: |
      ls /dev | grep video
      bash bash_test.sh
    devices: vivid
```

## Default images available

Currently, the following `image` configurations are provided:

* riscv64:

  * image-riscv64-default.tar.xz

This image contains the following software:

* Full busybox 1.35.0 with ash shell
* Python 3.10.8
* pip 21.2.4
* v4l2-utils 1.22.1
* libgpiod tools 1.6.3
* git 2.31.7
* curl 7.88.1

## Required native image components

Your custom `image` package should include the required file system directory structure; to find out more please read [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_Hierarchy_Standard):

Additionally you will need:

* shell executable available from `/bin/sh`
* If you want to use [`python-packages`](./Python-packages.md) you need `pip` available in your $PATH.

## Create your own native image

You can create the `image` package using any method you like, but we recommend using `buildroot`. It provides a lot of configuration options and will produce the file structure that this action requires.

First, you may want to download the default `image` package configuration and modify it. The configuration is stored in the `image/<arch-name>` directory.

### Adding the applications

If you want to add applications that we do not currently offer in our build, take a look at the `configs/riscv64_defconfig` file. There you can add the additional applications offered by `buildroot`. You may also want to add specific package configurations or custom patches for them. See the `buildroot` documentation for more.

### Preparing the archive

Download the latest `buildroot` from [GitHub](https://github.com/buildroot/buildroot) and apply your configuration with:

```sh
make BR2_EXTERNAL=path/to/configuration name_defconfig
```

and start compiling:

```sh
make -j$(nproc)
```

This will take some time.

Eventually, you should have a `rootfs.tar` in the `buildroot/output/images` directory. Create the `xz` archive with `xz -z rootfs.tar'.

### Use your image

```yaml
- uses: antmicro/renode-linux-runner-action@v0
  with:
    arch: your-arch (i.e. riscv64)
    image-type: native
    image: path/to/image or URL
    renode-run: sh --help
```
